The rainforest will have to stretch up to the same latitude as the top of the far western island continent, the 
mountain range will need to be more intrusive to the rainforest.

Climate: rainforest and tropical weather at the southern end, maybe some desert above the mountains (kind of like texas),
grasslands going further north up to the tundra with mediocre summers and winters that get progressively worse as you go
north

Flora: (from south to north) rainforest, snow capped mountains with trees going a decent way up the slope, desert,
grassland, tundra, arctic

Fauna: vermin are almost unheard of on this continent due to the insanely high number of cats that roam the continent
(this includes everything from kittens up to top tier predators like lions and tigers). The rainforest is overflowing
with biodiversity and more species than anyone cares to classify. the animals that live in the mountains are mostly
domesticated cats, hunting/war dogs, and large animals kept in pens and cages for display/meat/leather/bone.

Home to the mountain dwarves and forest elves
  The dwarves grow the majority of their food under the mountains in their massive and complex cities full of levers,
  magma traps, and fancy as fuck dining halls. The dwarves have purposefully collapsed some caves to quell the demons that
  spring forth from the earth and are wary about digging deeper. This hasn't stopped their greed however and so they've
  begun venturing out of the mountains to begin strip mining the deserts to the north and the rainforest to the south. 
  This has obviously been met with some opposition from the elves.
