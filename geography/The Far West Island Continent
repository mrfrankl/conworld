Climate: tropical, warm, frequent rainfall, forests and swamps (we’ll need to change the map a bit- more forest, some 
marsh swampland, more rivers and lakes). Probably prone to tropical storms around the coastline during the rainy season.

Flora: The low growing plants are all 3’ (mushrooms, mosses, etc.) to 8’ (flowers, grasses) tall. Shrubs and bushes can
be as large as 20’-30’ high and possibly hundreds of feet deep. The same kind of plants you’d expect to see in a
rainforest only much much larger. The trees are all enormous, the size of giant redwoods or larger.

Fauna: the island is mostly populated by unintelligent dinosaurs. Some dragons and other draconic species are scattered
about the island. Lizardfolk live near the swamp/marshland (which is presumably near the coast, maybe in a gulf). Kobolds
live all over the island, being the most common sentient life on the continent.
