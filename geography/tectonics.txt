Plate tectonics:

Idea - use Ising model to generate fractal boundaries, then assign plate drift velocities:
  -velocities from, say, 3d6 cm/year in a random direction?
  -Specified as relative to a fixed "zero point", which is debatable.
May add in extra small plates near boundaries
  -Also hot spots, plumes
  
Ensure faults are dealt with properly.
  -Use to lay oceans, mountains, island chains, areas of tectonic activity
