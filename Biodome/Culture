Lizard Folk- primitive culture
  swamp dwellers live in harmony with herbivorous dinosaurs
  desert dwellers live in caves with deep systems of caverns, largely nocturnal, venturing outside at night to hunt

Centaurs - largely nomadic, territorial 
  Think more moose/elk than quarter-horse, deal well with deep snow
  Raise large herds of reindeer, have Sami-like aesthetic 
    Very tall yurts

Dwarves - Torn between order/stability/industry and mad, chaotic invention
  Tend to develop amazing technology and then have it explode
  Environmental damage is basically a non-issue; areas around forts tend to be slag-heaps
  
Elves - Immortal (save for violence) and breed at normal human rate
  The limiter? Split into small bands or tribes, and sunk into brutal intertribal warfare
  Think about it. You can remember the feud going back 500 years, with atrocities on all sides
  Like the Balkans, but more so.
