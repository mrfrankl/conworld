Things we enjoy:
  -Some epoch of this world resembles a classic high-fantasy world, with some odd tweaks.
  -Question: magic only then? magic always? 

  -Suggestion: 2 Life supporting planets occupying the same orbit. Intelligent life evolves on one, the other one is
  Australia. Dangerous wildlife, possibly a prison colony?
