Things we enjoy:
  -Some epoch of this world resembles a classic high-fantasy world, with some odd tweaks.
  -Question: magic only then? magic always? 

  -Suggestion: 2 Life supporting planets occupying the same orbit. Intelligent life evolves on one, the other one is
  Australia. Dangerous wildlife, possibly a prison colony?

  -I like it. Although if both planets evolved intelligent life, you might get Space Australia having some sort of really scary sentients.

Okay, so what are some eras we'd be interested in detailing:
  -Classic high-fantasy!
  -Some modern-like setting, high magic
    -Maybe a 'fall of magic', with decreasing magical power
      -Declining into a WoD-like state?
  -Infinite Macabre or Eclipse Phase
    -First Contact with other inhabited worlds? Demons? DEMONS!
      -Space dreadnoughts bristling with atomic missiles?
